# Currency Convertor :money_with_wings:

In this project I have created an “Currency Converter” by using the HTML,CSS and JavaScript. We can convert of currency of one country to other country.The currency is default converted from USD to INR and then it is converted into the currency we want. We can convert currency of almost 120+ countries using this project.

## Documentation 

When user select a country using dropdown list, then he have to enter the amount he want to convert. Then user have to select the other country which currency he have to change with first country.

  Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market. In this web app, there is regular update about currency of every country by which it displays present currency market value and conversion rate.
